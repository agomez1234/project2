  NOT WET
  </strong>
    <h1>
  <strong>
	I think that water is not wet because, you cant say that water is wet. 
  </strong>
  </h1>	
  <h1>
  <strong>
    If you put water on top of water, its the same substance still, therefore you cannot call water wet
  </strong>
  </h1>
  <h1>
  <strong>
  If you were to go into water, you wouldn't be wet, but when you come out of water, then you would be wet
  </strong>
  </h1>
  <h1>
  The definition of water is something covered or saturated with water, If you think about it, you cannot cover or saturate water with water
  </h1>  
  <h1> 
  THEREFORE WATER IS NOT WET!!!
